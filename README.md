#  Statisticians – Python Calculators

This repository contains two Python-based calculator projects:

1. **Simple Calculator** – a beginner-friendly program that demonstrates the basics of user input, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations.  
2. **Calculator Agent** – a more advanced, AI-inspired command-line agent that can interpret natural text commands, perform safe math evaluation, convert units, compute statistics, and even generate CSV files.
